# UCSD Simulator (A 24 Hour Final Project)
## COGS 18 Final Project

This project is a choose your own adventure story that will allow anyone to have the first year UCSD experience, from suffering in classes due to back-to-back midterms all the way up to week 10 to spending money and dining dollars that you don't have.

The player of this story will be a new incoming student to UCSD with stats, a class list, major, inventory, and commuter status; all of these attributes will contribute to how the story will play. The player will also have methods that will allow the player to check their inventory as well as check their current stats.

The story is run by multiple functions that will determine a lot of the character's attributes as well as facilitate the creation of multiple branches and story paths.
